Designing low-level I/O procedures 

This program reinforces concepts in string primitive instructions and macros. It implements two macros: one that gets string inputs from the user and another that displays them while checking that the values after being converted into int are within range. It collects 10 signed decimals, calculates their sum and truncated average, and displays all of that to console.
